* eglot-jl

This is a simple package to make using [[https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl][Julia's language server]] easier
with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]. It can be installed with the recipe:


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  '(eglot-jl :type git :host github :repo "non-Jedi/eglot-jl" :files ("*.el" "*.jl" "*.toml"))
#+end_src

After installation the interactive function ~eglot-jl-init~ will load
support for the Julia language server into eglot and project.el. After
a call to ~eglot-jl-init~, calling ~eglot~ in a ~julia-mode~ buffer
will correctly start the language server.
